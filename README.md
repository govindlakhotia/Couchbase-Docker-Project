# Couchbase Docker Project

## Introduction

Couchbase is a high-performance, open-source NoSQL database designed for modern application development. It combines the flexibility of JSON document storage with the power of SQL-like querying, full-text search, and real-time analytics. Couchbase is widely used for building scalable, distributed applications.
In this project, Couchbase is containerized using Docker, making it easy to set up, manage, and access a local instance for development or testing purposes.

## Steps to Setup and Run Couchbase

**Step 1: Pull the Couchbase Docker Image**
To begin, the official Couchbase image was pulled from Docker Hub:

docker pull couchbase
